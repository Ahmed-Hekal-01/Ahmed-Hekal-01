# About Me:
I am a Junior Android Developer with a strong foundation in Kotlin, Java, and Android SDK, specializing in building intuitive and efficient mobile applications. I have experience working with Jetpack libraries (Compose, ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation), Firebase, RESTful APIs, and SQLite/Room, allowing me to develop apps that are both user-friendly and scalable.

I follow clean code practices and modern architectures such as MVVM, focusing on maintainability and performance. Beyond coding, I am passionate about continuous learning, problem-solving, and staying updated with the latest Android trends and tools.

My goal is to grow into a skilled Android Engineer who contributes to impactful projects, collaborates effectively in teams, and delivers mobile solutions that improve everyday experiences.
